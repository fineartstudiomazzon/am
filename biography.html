                    <p><strong>Born in Rome</strong>, Papal States, to Paolo Mancini, a tailor from Narni, and Domenica Cinti from Terni. The family was of modest means, with Paolo working as a craftsman to support the household.</p>

                    <p><strong>Admission to Academy of Fine Arts, Naples:</strong> Antonio was admitted to the prestigious Istituto di Belle Arti at just twelve years old—an unprecedented early admission that reflected his extraordinary talent. He relocated to Naples for his studies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Principal Teachers:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Domenico Morelli</strong> - Master of dramatic historical scenes, taught chiaroscuro technique</li>
                        <li><strong>Filippo Palizzi</strong> - Advocate of meticulous naturalism and direct observation</li>
                        <li><strong>Stanislao Lista</strong> - Focused on draftsmanship and technical foundation</li>

                    <p><strong>Friendship with Vincenzo Gemito:</strong> During his Naples years, Mancini became close friends with sculptor Vincenzo Gemito, who was the same age. Together they shared a poor and difficult youth, often "hawking drawings for bread" in the streets. This shared experience of poverty profoundly influenced both artists' work, enabling authentic empathy with their subjects—the scugnizzi (street urchins) and saltimbanchi (acrobats) of Naples.</p>

                    <p><strong>First Major Sales at Neapolitan Promotrice:</strong> Two of Mancini's works were purchased by foreign patrons, both painters:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>"For a Flower" (Per un fiore)</strong> - Purchased by Canadian-American painter François B. De Blois. Subject: an urchin offering a bloom.</li>
                        <li><strong>"The Last Medicine!" (L'ultima medicina)</strong> - Purchased by Frenchman Félix de Lapommeraye. Subject: a dying child's final rite.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These international sales at age nineteen established Mancini's early reputation beyond Italy.</p>

                    <p><strong>First Venice Visit:</strong> Mancini traveled to Venice where he was deeply impressed by Venetian painting, especially Titian. This exposure would later influence his shift toward brighter palettes and more luminous colors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Paris Salon:</strong> Participated in the Paris Salon, bringing his work to international attention.</p>

                    <p><strong>"The Poor Schoolboy":</strong> This masterwork was shown at the Paris Salon and is now in the Musée d'Orsay. The painting demonstrates Mancini's ability to capture pathos while maintaining technical excellence, showing the influence of Manet's "unsparing gaze" while remaining "rooted in Italian soil."</p>

                    <p><strong>Move to Paris:</strong> Mancini relocated to Paris for several months, working for major art dealers Adolphe Goupil and Hendrik Willem Mesdag. This was a period of intense artistic activity but also growing psychological pressure.</p>
                    <p><strong>Artistic Encounters:</strong> In Paris, Mancini met the leading artists of the day:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Edgar Degas</strong> - Admired Mancini's draftsmanship</li>
                        <li><strong>Édouard Manet</strong> - Influenced Mancini's direct observation and "unsparing gaze"</li>
                        <li><strong>John Singer Sargent</strong> - Began a lifelong friendship; Sargent called Mancini "the greatest living painter"</li>
                        <li><strong>Ernest Meissonier and Jean-Léon Gérôme</strong> - Provided technical counsel</li>

                    <p><strong>Return to Naples:</strong> Mancini returned to Naples suffering from illness and deep depressive episodes. The commercial pressures of the Paris art market—the demand to paint "sellable pretty pictures"—had clashed with his artistic nature.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-item">

                    <p><strong>Mental Health Crisis:</strong> Mancini was admitted to a nursing home/Provincial Asylum of Naples, where he remained until 1883. Despite his confinement, he continued to paint, creating portraits of patients and self-portraits. He emerged from this period destitute but determined to continue his artistic work.</p>

                    <p><strong>Meeting Aurelia:</strong> Around this time, Mancini met "Aurelia," who became both his model and life companion. Though they never married, she remained with him for the rest of his life and appears in numerous paintings from 1887 onward.</p>

Mancini shipped approximately 150 works over the duration of their relationship. This arrangement proved to be a financial lifeline, providing stability during difficult years. Today, the Mesdag Collectie in The Hague holds the largest concentration of Mancini works worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Personal Character and Relationships</h2>
            <p>Mancini never married and had no children. His life companion Aurelia provided emotional support and served as his primary model from the late 1880s until his death. Despite his mental health struggles, Mancini maintained important friendships throughout his life—particularly with Vincenzo Gemito and John Singer Sargent, both of whom understood and supported his artistic vision.</p>

            <p>His personality reflected the tensions of his art: deeply empathetic with the poor and marginalized, yet capable of painting elite society; technically obsessive (the graticola method), yet willing to embed "trash" in wet paint; traditionalist in subject matter, yet revolutionary in technique.</p>

            <p>The poverty of his youth never left him. Even during periods of patronage and relative stability, Mancini remained connected to the street subjects of his early works. His authentic understanding of poverty—having lived it himself—gave his depictions of scugnizzi and saltimbanchi a dignity and psychological depth that separated him from artists who merely romanticized the poor.</p>

        <section id="legacy-bio">
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Antonio Mancini's life trajectory—from child prodigy admitted to the Academy at twelve, through mental health crisis and poverty, to late recognition by the Academy of Italy at seventy-seven—embodies the complex relationship between artistic genius and personal struggle.</p>

            <p>Despite exposure to French Impressionism, Mancini carved a unique path, remaining connected to Italian naturalism while pioneering techniques that anticipated twentieth-century assemblage art. John Singer Sargent's assessment—"the greatest living painter"—reflects the esteem in which Mancini was held by his fellow artists, even when broader public recognition came late.</p>

            <p>Today, Mancini is considered "the most admired painter by professional academic artists," and major collections worldwide preserve his revolutionary works.</p>
